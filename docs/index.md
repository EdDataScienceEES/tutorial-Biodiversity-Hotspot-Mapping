## Biodiversity Hotspot Mapping

### Tutorial Aims

##### 1. Understand the variety of functions in the `dplyr` package and its application to biodiversity data.

##### 2. Learn to creatively combine and manipulate biodiversity tables and spatial data.

##### 3. Become efficient and creative in manipulating species occurrence data and environmental variables.

### <a name="section1">Introduction</a>

Biodiversity hotspot mapping is the process of identifying areas on Earth that are particularly rich in species diversity and are under threat from human activities. These hotspots are often characterized by high levels of unique species found nowhere else, making them critical for conservation efforts. Mapping these areas allows us to prioritize regions for protection and sustainable management.

In this tutorial, we focus on how to map biodiversity hotspots using species occurrence data and environmental factors. We start by retrieving data on species, such as the gorilla, from sources like the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)](https://www.gbif.org/zh/), which provides information on where different species are found.

By visualizing the occurrence of species over environmental factors, we can identify areas where species thrive. This can help us understand the relationship between species distribution and the environment. You'll learn how to handle and visualize biodiversity data in `R` using the `dplyr` package for data manipulation, and spatial analysis techniques with `ggplot2` and `raster` to create informative maps.

The goal of biodiversity hotspot mapping is not just to show where species live, but to inform conservation strategies by focusing attention on areas that need protection the most. This process ultimately helps in preserving our planetâ€™s most vulnerable ecosystems and species.

#### <a name="section2">Prerequisites</a>

This tutorial is suitable for those with a basic understanding of data manipulation and visualization in `R`. We will cover concepts ranging from basic data cleaning and transformation with `dplyr`, to more advanced spatial analysis with `ggplot2` and `raster`. To make the most of this tutorial, you should be familiar with:

- Data manipulation using `dplyr` and `tidyr`
- Data visualization with `ggplot2`

If you're new to these topics or need a refresher, there are excellent resources available on the Coding Club website:

#### <a name="section3">Data and Materials</a>

You can find all the data that you require for completing this tutorial on this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/tutorial-xiongshizhao). We encourage you to download the data to your computer and work through the examples throughout the tutorial as this will reinforces your understanding of the concepts taught in the tutorial.

**Now, let's get started!**


Begin by setting up a new R script. At the very top, include a few lines to introduce the project, such as your name, the date, and a brief description. Don't forget to use hashtags (#) for comments to keep things neat and clear!

<div class="code-container" style="position: relative; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 5px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f9f9f9;">
    <button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode('code-block-biodiversity')" style="position: absolute; top: 10px; right: 10px; background-color: #4CAF50; color: white; border: none; padding: 5px 10px; border-radius: 5px; cursor: pointer;">Copy</button>
    <pre id="code-block-biodiversity" style="margin: 0; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 14px; background: none; border: none;">
# Biodiversity Hotspot
# Author: Your Name
# Date: `r Sys.Date()`
    </pre>
</div>







At the beginning of your tutorial you can ask people to open `RStudio`, create a new script by clicking on `File/ New File/ R Script` set the working directory and load some packages, for example `ggplot2` and `dplyr`. You can surround package names, functions, actions ("File/ New...") and small chunks of code with backticks, which defines them as inline code blocks and makes them stand out among the text, e.g. `ggplot2`.

When you have a larger chunk of code, you can paste the whole code in the `Markdown` document and add three backticks on the line before the code chunks starts and on the line after the code chunks ends. After the three backticks that go before your code chunk starts, you can specify in which language the code is written, in our case `R`.

To find the backticks on your keyboard, look towards the top left corner on a Windows computer, perhaps just above `Tab` and before the number one key. On a Mac, look around the left `Shift` key. You can also just copy the backticks from below.

```r
# Set the working directory
setwd("your_filepath")

# Load packages
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

<a name="section2"></a>

## 2. The second section

You can add more text and code, e.g.

```r
# Create fake data
x_dat <- rnorm(n = 100, mean = 5, sd = 2)  # x data
y_dat <- rnorm(n = 100, mean = 10, sd = 0.2)  # y data
xy <- data.frame(x_dat, y_dat)  # combine into data frame
```

Here you can add some more text if you wish.

```r
xy_fil <- xy %>%  # Create object with the contents of `xy`
	filter(x_dat < 7.5)  # Keep rows where `x_dat` is less than 7.5
```

And finally, plot the data:

```r
ggplot(data = xy_fil, aes(x = x_dat, y = y_dat)) +  # Select the data to use
	geom_point() +  # Draw scatter points
	geom_smooth(method = "loess")  # Draw a loess curve
```

At this point it would be a good idea to include an image of what the plot is meant to look like so students can check they've done it right. Replace `IMAGE_NAME.png` with your own image file:

## 3. The third section

More text, code and images.

This is the end of the tutorial. Summarise what the student has learned, possibly even with a list of learning outcomes. In this tutorial we learned:

##### - how to generate fake bivariate data
##### - how to create a scatterplot in ggplot2
##### - some of the different plot methods in ggplot2

We can also provide some useful links, include a contact form and a way to send feedback.
